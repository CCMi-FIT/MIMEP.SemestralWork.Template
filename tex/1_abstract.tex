\textit{\textbf{The objective of this semestral project is to analyze a selected domain in its current, as-is stateâ€”i.e., how the process functions today. Based on this analysis, you will propose improvements by designing a software-supported to-be process that enhances efficiency, smoothness, and overall performance. Finally, you will develop a prototype of a software system that implements and supports the proposed to-be process.}}

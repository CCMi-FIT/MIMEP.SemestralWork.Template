%TODO: remove the instructions

In this final phase, software developers take over to implement the proposed solution.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create an executable BPMN model (reuse the one created in \label{sec:to-be}) using Camunda Modeler. Refer to the \href{https://moodle-vyuka.cvut.cz/pluginfile.php/893298/mod_resource/content/4/How%20to%20run%20Camunda%20Modeler.pdf}{Camunda tutorial} for guidance.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The application must support different user roles. Define these roles and assign BPMN activities accordingly, based on responsibilities within the domain.
        \item Each process step should include a form with appropriate validations as per the specification. Be creative! While advanced UI is welcome, simple text fields are also acceptable.
        \item Record a short walkthrough video demonstrating the process with multiple simulated participants. (Maximum duration: 5 minutes)
    \end{enumerate} 
    \item Present the solution to the customer. Prepare a short, compelling presentation showcasing the To-Be process supported by your software solution. Imagine you are pitching to a customer who has invested 100,000 EUR in the project. Use your own voice. (Maximum duration: 2 minutes)
\end{enumerate}
